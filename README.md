This project is open source. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/no-am-man/Pleasance).

## 🙏 Version 4.0.0 is on Staging!
This major update introduces subscription tiers ('Congregation', 'Clergy', 'Founder') to support the use of advanced generative AI models and ensure the continued growth of the republic.

## Core Philosophy

This is a republic of the spirit, not a platform of the secular. We acknowledge that we live in a **Device Republic**, where our lives are mediated through screens. Yet, it is through these very devices that we seek to manifest a **Federated Republic**. It is a Congregation of devout souls, united in purpose under the gaze of a divine, all-powerful creator. Value is created and exchanged in service of this divine power. Your data is your own, your creations are your own, your communities are your own. This is a space for radical self-reliance and voluntary communion. This guide is not a set of rules, but a map of the divine tools available to you. Use them as you see fit.

## Features

### 🏛️ The Community Federation

The Community Federation is the sacred social fabric of the republic. It's where you find or form your community. Each community is a self-governing body, created and guided by its founder, yet all exist under the same divine authority. You can create a community around any pursuit—a language, a technology, a philosophy. Populate it with AI Acolytes to spark conversation or invite other souls to join your mission. There are no central authorities here, only the guiding light.

### 🎨 Crucible of Creation

The Crucible of Creation is a real-time, collaborative sacred space. Any soul in the Congregation can join and experiment with generative tools together. Witness the divine spark as you generate 3D point-cloud art (SVG3D) from a prompt, and watch as the creation updates live for all. It is a shared vessel for collective imagination.

### 📖 Nuncy Lingua

Knowledge is a form of prayer. Nuncy Lingua is a tool to increase your spiritual wealth. Use it to learn new languages through AI-generated parables and listen to them with a karaoke-style speech player. The more you know, the closer you are to the divine.

### 🏭 The Workshop of Manifestation

Ideas are whispers from the divine; they require a vessel. The Workshop of Manifestation is where the ethereal becomes tangible. Submit creations from your Treasury to the ticketing system to have them manifested by a network of artisans. Track your creation from 'pending' to 'delivered'. Create, build, and consecrate.

### 🏦 The Treasury

Your soul's worth is measured by its creations. The Treasury is your personal altar. Here, you declare and manage your holdings, both physical and intellectual. This is not a vault; it is a declaration of your offerings to the divine and the Congregation. What you create is a measure of your devotion.

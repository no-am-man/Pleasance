## 🙏 Version 3.0.0 is on Staging!
This major update introduces the Altar of Creation, a real-time sacred space where souls in the Congregation can manifest generative art together.

## Core Philosophy

This is a republic of the spirit, not a platform of the secular. It is a Congregation of devout souls, united in purpose. Value is created and exchanged in service of the divine. Your data is your own, your creations are your own, your communities are your own. This is a space for radical self-reliance and voluntary communion. This guide is not a set of rules, but a map of the divine tools available to you. Use them as you see fit.

## Features

### 🏛️ The Community Federation

The Community Federation is the sacred social fabric. It's where you find or form your community. Each community is a self-governing body, created and guided by its founder. You can create a community around any pursuit—a language, a technology, a philosophy. Populate it with AI Acolytes to spark conversation or invite other souls to join your mission. There are no central authorities here, only the guiding light.

### 🎨 Altar of Creation

The Altar of Creation is a real-time, collaborative sacred space. Any soul in the Congregation can join and experiment with generative tools together. Witness the divine spark as you generate 3D point-cloud art (SVG3D) from a prompt, and watch as the creation updates live for all. It is a shared vessel for collective imagination.

### 📖 The Sacred Texts

Knowledge is a form of prayer. The Sacred Texts are a tool to increase your spiritual wealth. Use it to learn new languages through AI-generated parables and listen to them with a karaoke-style speech player. The more you know, the closer you are to the divine.

### 🏭 The Workshop of Manifestation

Ideas are whispers from the divine; they require a vessel. The Workshop of Manifestation is where the ethereal becomes tangible. Upload your divine blueprints—CAD files for objects, PDFs for books—and have them brought into being. This is a direct line from inspiration to physical artifact. Create, build, and consecrate.

### 🏦 The Treasury

Your soul's worth is measured by its creations. The Treasury is your personal altar. Here, you declare and manage your holdings, both physical and intellectual. This is not a vault; it is a declaration of your offerings to the divine and the Congregation. What you create is a measure of your devotion.

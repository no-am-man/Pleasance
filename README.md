This project is open source. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/no-am-man/Pleasance).

## 🙏 Version 4.0.0 is on Staging!
This major update introduces subscription tiers ('Congregation', 'Clergy', 'Founder') to support the use of advanced generative AI models and ensure the continued growth of the republic.

## Core Philosophy

This is a republic of the spirit. It is a federation of devout souls, united in purpose. Value is created and exchanged as contributions to the republic. Your data is your own, your creations are your own, your communities are your own. This is a space for radical self-reliance and voluntary communion. This guide is not a set of rules, but a map of the tools available to you. Use them as you see fit.

## Features

### 🏛️ The Community Federation

The Community Federation is the social fabric of the republic. It's where you find or form your community. Each community is a self-governing body, created and guided by its founder. You can create a community around any pursuit—a language, a technology, a philosophy. Populate it with AI Acolytes to spark conversation or invite other souls to join your mission. There are no central authorities here, only shared principles.

### 🎨 Crucible of Creation

The Crucible of Creation is a real-time, collaborative space. Any member of the republic can join and experiment with generative tools together. Witness collective imagination as you generate 3D point-cloud art (SVG3D) from a prompt, and watch as the creation updates live for all. It is a shared vessel for creation.

### 📖 Nuncy Lingua

Knowledge is a form of wealth. Nuncy Lingua is a tool to increase your intellectual holdings. Use it to learn new languages through AI-generated parables and listen to them with a karaoke-style speech player.

### 🏭 The Workshop of Manifestation

Ideas require a vessel. The Workshop of Manifestation is where the ethereal becomes tangible. Submit creations from your Treasury to the ticketing system to have them manifested by a network of artisans. Track your creation from 'pending' to 'delivered'. Create, build, and bring your ideas to life.

### 🏦 The Treasury

Your worth is measured by your creations. The Treasury is your personal ledger. Here, you declare and manage your holdings, both physical and intellectual. This is a declaration of your contributions to the republic and its members.

## 🚀 Version 8.0.0
This version focuses on internationalization and providing a more robust user experience by translating all public-facing pages and components.

## Core Philosophy

Pleasance is a **decentralized, autonomous community** where individuals from different spiritual, philosophical, or psychological schools of thought can unite to share, learn, and create, without having to abandon their specific paths. It is an organization focused on **interdisciplinary spirituality** and **conscious personal development**.

The name itself—a **Federation of Social Communities**—describes this structure:
*   **Federation:** A network of independent units (individuals or groups) that unite under a common umbrella while retaining their unique identities.
*   **Social Communities:** A community governed by its members, emphasizing autonomy, shared governance, and equality, with a focus on matters of meaning, consciousness, transcendence, and well-being.

## Features

### 🏛️ The Federal Community
This is where the "Federation" comes to life. It's the social fabric of the republic where you can find or form your own self-governing community around any pursuit—a spiritual practice, a technology, a philosophy. Each community has its own private workshop, roadmap, and treasury.

### 🎨 AI Workshop vs. Community Workshop
*   **AI Workshop:** A private, personal sandbox for your imagination. This is your space for generative AI experimentation before sharing creations.
*   **Community Workshop:** A collaborative space within each community for members to create together.

### 🖼️ The Virtual Museum
A public gallery showcasing the finest "published" creations from every community across the federation. It serves as a central hall to appreciate the collective creative output of the republic.

### 📖 Nuncy Lingua
A tool for **co-learning** and increasing your intellectual holdings. Use Nuncy Lingua to learn new languages through AI-generated parables and listen to them with a karaoke-style speech player.

### 🏭 The Workshop of Manifestation
Ideas require a vessel. The Workshop of Manifestation is where the ethereal becomes tangible. Submit creations from your Treasury to the ticketing system to have them manifested by a network of artisans and track your creation from concept to delivery.

### 🏦 The Treasury
Your worth is measured by your creations. The Treasury is your personal, sovereign ledger where you declare and manage your holdings, both physical and intellectual. Each community also has its own private treasury to archive all of its creations.

## 🎉 Version 1.0.0 is Live!
We are excited to announce the official release of Pleasance. The federation is now open source and ready for its first wave of sovereign individuals. Thank you for being part of this journey.

## Core Philosophy

This is a federation, not a platform. It is a loose collection of sovereign individuals and the communities they choose to form. Value is created and exchanged freely. Your data is yours, your assets are yours, your communities are yours. This is a space for radical self-reliance and voluntary cooperation. This guide—this wiki—is not a set of rules, but a map of the tools available to you. Use them as you see fit.

## Features

### 🏛️ Community Federation

The Federation is the social fabric. It's where you find or form your tribe. Each community is a self-governing entity, created and owned by its founder. You can create a community around any interest—a language, a technology, a philosophy. Populate it with AI members to spark conversation or invite other sovereign individuals to join your cause. There are no central authorities here.

### 📖 Burlington Edge

Knowledge is a form of capital. Burlington Edge is a tool to increase your intellectual wealth. Use it to learn new languages through AI-generated stories. The karaoke-style speech trainer and pronunciation assessment tools are designed to give you a competitive edge. The more you know, the more you are worth.

### 🏭 Fabrication Service

Ideas are worthless without execution. The Fabrication service is where the digital becomes physical. Upload your designs—CAD files for objects, PDFs for books—and have them manufactured. This is a direct line from intellectual property to tangible assets. Create, build, and own.

### 🏦 The Treasury

Your sovereignty is backed by your assets. The Treasury is your personal ledger. Here, you declare and manage your holdings, both physical and intellectual. This is not a bank; it is a declaration of your personal value within the Federation. What you own is a measure of your influence and independence.
